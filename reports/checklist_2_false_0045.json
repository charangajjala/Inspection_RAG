      "finding": "The inspection revealed that tools and materials are not maintained at the required minimum distance of 10 feet from energized power lines. OSHA standards and accident reports emphasize the importance of maintaining adequate clearance to prevent electrical contact. Failures to maintain these clearances have resulted in electrocutions, severe burns, and fatalities. The close proximity of scaffold materials to live power lines significantly increases worker exposure to electrical hazards.",
