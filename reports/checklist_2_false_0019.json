      "finding": "The inspection revealed that guardrails and toeboards are not installed on all open sides of the scaffold. This non-compliance significantly increases the risk of falls from height and injuries from falling tools or debris, which are well-known hazards leading to fatalities and severe injuries in the construction industry.",

OSHA and accident reports identify improper access as a common cause of falls resulting in injuries and fatalities.",
      "finding": "Employees are accessing the scaffold by climbing on crossbraces, which is not a compliant or safe method of access. Crossbraces are not designed to provide footing or handholds, creating a high risk of losing balance and falling from heights.",

        "Provide safe and compliant scaffold access such as ladders, stair towers, ramps, or integral scaffold access frames.",
