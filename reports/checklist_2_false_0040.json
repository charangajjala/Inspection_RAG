      "finding": "The scaffold setup does not maintain the required OSHA specified clearance distances from energized power lines. This non-compliance significantly increases the risk of electrical contact during scaffold erection or use, potentially resulting in electrocution or severe electrical burns. Historical accident reports show multiple fatalities and injuries due to contact with power lines, highlighting the severity of this hazard.",

This unsafe practice elevates the risk of accidental contact or electrical arcing, leading to severe injury or death. Numerous accident reports confirm that proximity to power lines has caused multiple electrocutions and electrical burns in scaffold operations.",
