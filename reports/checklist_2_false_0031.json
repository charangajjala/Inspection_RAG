      "risk_level": "Critical",
      "risk_justification": "Use of crossbraces for scaffold access is strictly prohibited by OSHA (1926.451(e)(1)) because it poses a severe fall hazard. Multiple accident reports document fatal falls associated with improper scaffold access, including falls from high elevations and injuries due to unstable climbing methods.",
      "finding": "The current scaffold setup requires employees to climb on crossbraces to access the scaffold. This violates OSHA standards that explicitly prohibit using crossbraces as a means of access. Climbing crossbraces increases the risk of falls from height, which have historically resulted in serious injuries and fatalities as evidenced in past accident reports where employees fell due to unstable or improper scaffold access.",

      "risk_justification": "OSHA standards require that scaffold footings be level, sound, rigid, and capable of supporting loaded scaffolds without displacement (1926.451(c)(2)). Failure to comply can lead to scaffold instability, tipping, and collapse. Accident reports show incidents with scaffold falls and tipping associated with inadequate footing or base support.",
      "finding": "The scaffold's footings do not meet OSHA requirements for level, sound, rigid, and adequate load support as indicated by the inspection checklist result. This compromises scaffold stability and raises the risk of displacement or collapse during use, potentially causing falls or serious injuries.",
