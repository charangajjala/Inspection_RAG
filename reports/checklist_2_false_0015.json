      "finding": "The inspection revealed that employees involved with or near the scaffold are not wearing hard hats. This violation of basic PPE protocols significantly increases the risk of head injuries from falling tools, debris, or scaffold components, as highlighted in OSHA regulations and supported by accident histories where lack of head protection contributed to severe injuries or fatalities.",
