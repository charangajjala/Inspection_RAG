      "checklist_result": "False",
      "risk_level": "High",
      "risk_justification": "Failure to maintain proper clearance distance increases the risk of falls from scaffold edges as employees may be forced to lean or reach excessively, potentially leading to loss of balance and falling incidents. Historical accident contexts emphasize the danger of inadequate platform distance causing fatal falls.",
      "finding": "The scaffold front face is not positioned within the OSHA recommended distance of 14 inches or 3 inches for outrigger scaffolds from the work surface. This non-compliance exposes workers to fall hazards and destabilizes proper working posture on the scaffold platform. Guardrails and personal fall arrest systems must compensate for any deviation, but maintaining this clearance is fundamental to scaffold safety.",
