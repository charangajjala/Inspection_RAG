OSHA requires guardrails to be installed along all open sides and ends before scaffold use by employees other than erection/dismantling crews (1926.451(g)(4)).",
      "finding": "The scaffold currently lacks guardrails and toeboards on all open sides. This exposes employees to a high risk of falling from elevation or being struck by falling objects. Historical accident reports underscore that lack of guardrails frequently results in fatal fall incidents and injuries. Guardrails and toeboards are critical for fall prevention and for protecting employees below from dropped tools or materials.",
