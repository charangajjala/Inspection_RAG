      "risk_justification": "Improper footing foundation can lead to scaffold settlement or displacement, which poses a critical risk of scaffold collapse and serious or fatal injuries, as supported by OSHA requirements that footings must be capable of supporting the loaded scaffold without displacement (1926.451(c)(2)(i-iii)). Historical accident reports repeatedly indicate falls and deaths attributable to structural failures and instability.",
      "finding": "The scaffold footings inspected are not level, sound, rigid, and capable of supporting the loaded scaffold, violating OSHA requirements. This deficiency threatens the structural integrity and stability of the scaffold, increasing the risk that the scaffold could shift, tip, or collapse during use.

      "finding": "The scaffold's legs, posts, frames, and uprights are not positioned on proper baseplates and mudsills, contravening OSHA directives. This creates an unstable scaffold structure vulnerable to movement, swaying, or collapse when loaded, thereby endangering workers\u2019 safety and increasing fall hazards.",
