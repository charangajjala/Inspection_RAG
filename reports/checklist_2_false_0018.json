      "finding": "During inspection, it was observed that not all employees working on or near the scaffold were wearing hard hats. OSHA standards require hard hats as a minimum protection against falling objects. Historical accident contexts show that absence of adequate head protection has resulted in severe injuries and fatalities.",
