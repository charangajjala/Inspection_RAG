      "checklist_result": "False",
      "risk_level": "Critical",
      "risk_justification": "Scaffold sections that are not pinned or properly secured significantly increase the risk of scaffold collapse or displacement. Historic accident reports document fatal falls and crushing injuries resulting from scaffolds tipping or collapsing due to improper securing of components.",
      "finding": "During the inspection, it was observed that not all scaffold sections were pinned or appropriately secured. This condition compromises the structural integrity of the scaffold, increasing the risk of collapse or sudden displacement while in use. Given the critical role of pins and secure connections in maintaining scaffold stability, this deficiency presents a serious hazard to workers on and near the scaffold.",
      "action_items": [
        "Immediately secure all scaffold sections using appropriate pins or locking devices as per manufacturer guidelines and OSHA standards.",
        "Conduct a full structural inspection of the scaffold assembly to verify all connections are secure before allowing employee access.",

Historical accident reports show severe injuries and fatalities associated with scaffold collapse due to footing failure.",
      "finding": "Inspection revealed that the scaffold footings are not level, sound, rigid, or otherwise capable of supporting the loaded scaffold adequately. This condition endangers the entire scaffold's stability and may result in hazardous displacement or collapse under the loads imposed during use.",
      "action_items": [
        "Ensure footings are constructed on firm, level, and rigid surfaces such as mud sills or base plates in compliance with OSHA requirements.",
        "Remove any unstable objects or makeshift supports from scaffold footings.",
