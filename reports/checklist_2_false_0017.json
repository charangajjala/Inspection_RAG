      "risk_justification": "Failure to wear hard hats greatly increases the risk of head injuries from falling objects or debris, which is a common hazard in scaffold-related accidents as supported by multiple accident reports involving head injuries.",
      "finding": "The inspection revealed that not all employees involved with or near the scaffold were wearing hard hats.

Numerous past scaffold-related accidents have resulted in serious head injuries or fatalities when employees were unprotected.",

      "finding": "The inspection identified that scaffold supports (legs, posts, frames, and uprights) are not resting on the required baseplates and mudsills or equivalent firm foundation. OSHA requires scaffold poles, legs, posts, frames, and uprights to bear on baseplates and mudsills or other adequate firm foundations to prevent settling or displacement. This deficiency compromises scaffold stability and safety, greatly increasing the risk of collapse.",
      "action_items": [
        "Immediately place all scaffold legs, posts, frames, and uprights on OSHA-compliant baseplates and mudsills or equivalent stable footing.",
        "Ensure footings are level, sound, rigid, and capable of supporting the loaded scaffold without settling or displacement.",
