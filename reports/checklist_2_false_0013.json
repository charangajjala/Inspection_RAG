      "checklist_result": "False",
      "risk_level": "High",
      "risk_justification": "Failure to wear hard hats exposes employees to head trauma from falling objects or scaffold components, a frequent cause of serious injury or fatality according to accident reports and OSHA standards emphasizing falling object protection.",
      "finding": "The inspection revealed that employees working on or near the scaffold were not wearing hard hats. OSHA standards specify that employees on scaffolds must wear hard hats and be provided with additional protection such as toeboards or guardrails to prevent injuries from falling tools, debris, and other objects. Non-use of hard hats significantly increases the risk of head injuries in the event of falling objects or scaffold structural failures, as indicated in multiple accident reports where lack of protective headgear contributed to fatal or severe injuries.",

        "Immediately enforce a mandatory hard hat policy for all workers on or near the scaffold.",

      "risk_level": "Critical",
      "risk_justification": "Failure to maintain required clearance distances from energized power lines is a critical hazard that directly causes electrocution incidents and fatalities, as demonstrated repeatedly in accident reports where scaffolds in close proximity to live electrical conductors led to death or severe electrical burns.",
      "finding": "The scaffold does not comply with OSHA-required electrical safety clearance distances. This presents a critical risk as scaffolds near energized power lines can result in accidental contact, electrical arcs, or conduction through scaffold components causing electrocution or severe electrical burns. The accident history provided includes multiple fatalities and serious injuries stemming from scaffold components or employees making contact with or being too close to high-voltage conductors. OSHA standards mandate specific clearance distances and protective measures to prevent these hazards.",
