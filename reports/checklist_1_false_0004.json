      "issue_title": "Non-compliance with Electrical Safety Clearance Distances",
      "checklist_item": "Does the scaffold meet electrical safety clearance distances?",
      "checklist_result": "False",
      "risk_level": "Critical",
      "risk_justification": "Failure to maintain required electrical clearance distances poses an immediate risk of electrocution. Historical accident reports show multiple fatalities and severe injuries resulting from scaffold components or employees contacting or coming dangerously close to energized power lines.",
      "finding": "The scaffold installation on site does not comply with OSHA requirements for maintaining safe clearance distances from overhead power lines. This violation exposes employees to the risk of electrical shock or electrocution. Several past accident reports demonstrate the severe consequences of ignoring electrical clearance protocols including fatal electrocutions when scaffold parts or workers contacted energized lines. The risk is heightened if high-voltage conductors are near the scaffold or if power lines are not properly de-energized or guarded.",
      "action_items": [
        "Immediately evaluate and mark all overhead power lines around the scaffold to ensure compliance with OSHA clearance distances as specified in 29 CFR 1926.451(f)(6).",
        "Coordinate with the utility company or electrical system operator to de-energize, relocate, or protect power lines if work must be performed closer than OSHA-specified distances.",
        "Provide comprehensive electrical hazard training to all employees working on or near the scaffold, emphasizing clearance requirements and procedures for working safely near power lines.",
        "Post clear signage and barriers to prevent accidental contact with overhead power lines during scaffold erection, use, and dismantling.",
        "Conduct frequent site inspections by a competent person to verify ongoing compliance with electrical safety requirements."

When close proximity to energized power lines is necessary, the utility company must be notified to deenergize, relocate, or install protective coverings."
