      "risk_justification": "Unsecured scaffold sections threaten the structural integrity and stability of the scaffold, increasing the risk of collapse or dislodgement, which can result in falls or crushing injuries. Historical accident reports show fatal falls and serious injuries resulting from scaffold component failures and improper assembly.",
      "finding": "The inspection revealed that not all scaffold sections were pinned or appropriately secured. This is a significant hazard because unsecured sections can shift or collapse under load or employee movement. OSHA standards (29 CFR 1926.451(d)(8)) require scaffold components to be properly joined and secured to ensure scaffold stability. Failure to do so has been linked to fatal scaffold falls and injuries as documented in accident reports where improper securing or loosened clamps led to employees falling from heights.",

      "checklist_result": "False",
      "risk_level": "Critical",
      "risk_justification": "Proper load distribution through baseplates and mudsills is critical to prevent scaffold settling, shifting, or collapse. Without adequate firm foundation, scaffolds are unstable and prone to tipping or failure, which could cause fatal falls or traumatic injuries. OSHA mandates supported scaffold poles, legs, posts, frames, and uprights bear on baseplates and mud sills or other firm foundation, as reiterated in multiple standards (29 CFR 1926.451(c)(2)). Failure to meet this requirement has historically resulted in scaffold collapses and fatalities.",
      "finding": "The inspection found scaffold legs, posts, frames, and uprights that are not all properly placed on baseplates and mudsills. This condition compromises scaffold stability by allowing uneven settling or displacement under load. OSHA regulations clearly require baseplates and mudsills or equivalent solid foundations to ensure scaffold stability. Past OSHA accident investigations have documented fatal scaffold collapses and severe injuries directly linked to improper footing and foundation support.",
