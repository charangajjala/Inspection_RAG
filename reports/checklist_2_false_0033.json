      "risk_level": "Critical",
      "risk_justification": "Climbing on crossbraces for access is explicitly prohibited as it creates a severe fall hazard, increasing the risk of fatal falls as supported by OSHA standards 1926.451(e)(1) and multiple accident reports involving falls from scaffolds due to unsafe access means.",
      "finding": "The scaffold access method currently requires employees to climb on crossbraces. This practice violates OSHA standards that strictly prohibit the use of crossbraces as access or egress routes. Unsafe scaffold access significantly elevates the risk of falls from height, which can result in severe injuries or fatalities as evidenced by historical accident reports where falls from scaffold platforms or while climbing resulted in blunt force trauma, fractures, or death.",
