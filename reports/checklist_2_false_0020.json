      "risk_justification": "The absence of guardrails and toeboards on all open sides presents an immediate fall hazard, which historically has resulted in fatal injuries and severe trauma as documented in multiple past scaffold-related accidents within the construction industry.",
      "finding": "The inspection revealed that guardrails and toeboards are missing on all open sides of the scaffold. According to OSHA standard 29 CFR 1926.451(g)(4), guardrail systems must be installed along all open sides and ends of scaffold platforms before releasing them for use by employees other than erection/dismantling crews. Additionally, toeboards or equivalent protection are required to prevent tools and materials from falling off platforms, protecting workers below. Failure to provide these protections significantly increases the risk of falls and injuries.",

      "risk_justification": "Unsecured scaffold sections can cause scaffold instability or collapse, placing workers at risk of falling or being crushed. Historical incidents show scaffold tipping and collapse resulted in fatalities and severe injuries.",
      "finding": "The scaffold sections were found not fully pinned or appropriately secured. OSHA requires that all scaffold components be securely fastened to prevent displacement, swaying, or collapse during use. The structural integrity of the scaffold depends significantly on the correct connection and securement of all scaffold sections (29 CFR 1926.451(c)(3)). Lack of secure connections increases the likelihood of scaffold instability and accidents.",
