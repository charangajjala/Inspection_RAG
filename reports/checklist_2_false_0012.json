      "issue_title": "Lack of Hard Hat Use by Employees Near or On Scaffold",
      "checklist_item": "Are all employees involved with (or near) the scaffold wearing hard hats?",
      "checklist_result": "False",
      "risk_level": "High",
      "risk_justification": "Failure to wear hard hats exposes employees to risk of head injuries from falling objects or accidental contact with scaffold components, a common cause of serious injury or fatality according to multiple accident reports.",
      "finding": "During the inspection, it was observed that employees involved with or near scaffold operations were not wearing hard hats. OSHA standards require employees on scaffolds to be provided with and wear hard hats in addition to other protective measures against falling objects or accidental impacts. The absence of this essential PPE significantly increases risk of injury from falling debris or tools, as supported by accident reports where lack of head protection resulted in fatal injuries.",
      "action_items": [
        "Ensure all employees working on or near scaffolds wear approved hard hats at all times.",
        "Provide training emphasizing the importance of head protection in preventing injuries from falling or flying objects.",

      "risk_level": "Critical",
      "risk_justification": "Unsecured scaffold sections pose a severe hazard of collapse or tipping, which can result in falls from elevation, multiple injuries, and fatalities as documented in scaffold tip-over accidents in the historical reports.",
      "finding": "The inspection revealed multiple scaffold sections were not fully pinned or secured as required. Proper securing of scaffold sections is critical to maintain structural integrity and prevent movement or collapse. Failure to secure scaffold sections has been directly linked to catastrophic scaffold tip-over incidents causing fatal crushing injuries and falls from significant heights.",
