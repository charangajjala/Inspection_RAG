      "checklist_item": "Are all sections pinned or appropriately secured?",
      "checklist_result": "False",
      "risk_level": "Critical",
      "risk_justification": "Unsecured scaffold sections pose a critical risk of scaffold collapse or displacement, leading to worker falls from height or scaffold failure, as evidenced by multiple fatal and severe injury accidents in past reports caused by structural failures or component detachment.",
      "finding": "The scaffold inspection revealed that not all scaffold sections were pinned or properly secured. This non-compliance creates a significant hazard of scaffold instability. According to OSHA standards (1926.451(a)(6)) and accident reports, failure to secure scaffold components can result in catastrophic falls and injuries from collapse or displacement of scaffold parts. Historical incidents have shown that unsecured parts contributed to falls from heights up to 48 feet with fatal outcomes.",
      "action_items": [
        "Ensure that all scaffold sections are securely pinned or fastened according to manufacturer specifications and OSHA requirements.",
        "Conduct inspections by a competent person before each work shift and after any event that could affect scaffold integrity to verify all sections remain secured.",
        "Provide immediate corrective action where any unsecured or loose scaffold component is identified.",
        "Train scaffold erectors and users to recognize the importance of securing all scaffold sections and components."
