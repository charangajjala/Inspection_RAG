      "checklist_result": "False",
      "risk_level": "Critical",
      "risk_justification": "Using crossbraces as means of access is explicitly prohibited by OSHA due to the serious risk of falls, which can result in fatal or severe injuries as evidenced by multiple scaffold fall incidents in the accident reports.",
      "finding": "The scaffold inspection revealed that employees may be using crossbraces to access or exit the scaffold. OSHA standards clearly prohibit the use of crossbraces as a means of access or egress (29 CFR 1926.451(e)(1)). Unsafe access methods significantly increase the risk of slips, trips, falls, and resulting injuries or fatalities, particularly during erecting and dismantling phases. Historical accident data corroborates the grave consequences of falls from scaffolds.",

        "Immediately eliminate any use of crossbraces as scaffold access points.",
        "Install approved access methods such as ladders, stair towers, ramps, or prefabricated scaffold frames according to OSHA specifications 29 CFR 1926.451(e).",
        "Conduct training for all employees on safe scaffold access and egress methods by a competent person, emphasizing the prohibition of crossbrace usage.",
