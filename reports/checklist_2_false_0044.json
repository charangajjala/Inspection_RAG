      "finding": "The scaffold inspected does not meet the required electrical safety clearance distances from energized power lines. OSHA standard 1926.451(f)(6) mandates minimum clearance distances to prevent accidental contact with power lines. Historical accident reports document fatalities and severe injuries due to scaffold contact with live electrical conductors, emphasizing the critical nature of compliance with clearance standards.",

      "finding": "The scaffold access was found to be non-compliant because employees are climbing on cross braces for access. OSHA standard 1926.451(e)(1) clearly prohibits the use of cross braces as a means of access, requiring instead the use of ladders, stair towers, ramps, or integral scaffold frames. Unsafe access methods increase the likelihood of falls and resultant serious injuries.",
