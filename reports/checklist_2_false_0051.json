      "checklist_result": "False",
      "risk_level": "High",
      "risk_justification": "Scaffolds with platform front faces exceeding the prescribed horizontal distances increase fall hazards substantially, as employees are required to reach or lean farther, which is a significant common cause of scaffold falls as noted in multiple accident reports involving falls from improperly situated scaffolds.",
      "finding": "The scaffold platform front face exceeds the OSHA-recommended maximum distance of 14 inches (36 cm) from the work for supported scaffolds, or 3 inches (8 cm) for outrigger scaffolds. This non-compliance creates additional fall risk by forcing employees to reach beyond safe limits while working, increasing the likelihood of losing balance and falling off the scaffold.",

      "finding": "The current scaffold access method includes climbing on cross braces, which is prohibited by OSHA standards. Cross braces are not designed for safe access or egress and do not provide secure footing or handholds. This practice greatly increases the risk of slips, trips, and falls from elevation.",
