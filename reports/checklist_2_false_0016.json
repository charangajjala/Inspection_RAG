      "risk_level": "High",
      "risk_justification": "Failure to wear hard hats exposes employees to head injuries from falling objects, a common hazard observed in scaffold-related incidents causing severe injury or fatality.",
      "finding": "During the inspection, it was observed that not all employees working on or near the scaffold were wearing hard hats. OSHA requires employees on scaffolds to wear protective helmets to mitigate head injuries from falling hand tools, debris, or other objects. Past accident cases have demonstrated serious head injuries and fatalities resulting from lack of proper head protection, underscoring the critical nature of this requirement.",
      "action_items": [
        "Enforce mandatory use of hard hats for all employees working on or near scaffolds.",

The training must include fall hazards, falling object hazards, electrical hazards, proper use of the scaffold, and handling of materials."

Historical accident reports reveal multiple fatalities and serious injuries caused by scaffold tipping and collapse due to inadequate foundation support.",
      "finding": "The footing of the scaffold was found to be non-compliant; it was not level, sound, rigid, or able to support the loaded scaffold adequately. OSHA mandates that scaffold footings must be firm, capable of carrying the scaffold load without settling or displacement, and constructed on solid foundations such as base plates and mud sills. This non-compliance poses an imminent danger of scaffold failure and potential catastrophic accidents.",
      "action_items": [
        "Immediately correct footing deficiencies by leveling and reinforcing the base.",
