      "checklist_result": "False",
      "risk_level": "Critical",
      "risk_justification": "Based on historical accident reports, proximity to energized power lines has led to multiple fatal electrocutions and serious electrical burn injuries. The lack of proper clearance for tools and materials near power lines poses an immediate and life-threatening electrocution hazard.",
      "finding": "The current scaffold setup has tools and materials positioned closer than the mandated 10 feet clearance from energized power lines. This non-compliance exposes workers to a high risk of electrical contact, which can lead to severe injury or death through electrocution or electrical burns. Past accidents have demonstrated the fatal consequences of such proximity when scaffolding components or materials contacted live conductors.",
      "action_items": [
        "Immediately relocate all tools and materials to maintain a minimum 10 feet clearance from energized power lines.",
        "Coordinate with the utility company or electrical system operator to de-energize, relocate, or provide protective coverings for the power lines if work must be conducted closer than 10 feet.",
        "Train employees on electrical hazards and enforce strict adherence to clearance distances near power lines.",
        "Conduct a competent person inspection daily and after any event to ensure ongoing compliance with electrical safety clearance requirements."
