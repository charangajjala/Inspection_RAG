      "checklist_result": "False",
      "risk_level": "Critical",
      "risk_justification": "The absence of hard hats on employees working on or near scaffolds substantially increases the risk of head injury from falling objects, debris, or accidental contact with scaffold components, which is a leading cause of fatal and serious injuries as documented in several accident reports.",
      "finding": "Employees on or in proximity to the scaffold were observed not wearing hard hats. This non-compliance with fundamental personal protective equipment requirements exposes workers to significant hazards including head trauma from falling materials or tools. OSHA standards explicitly require that each employee on a scaffold be provided with protection from falling objects by wearing hard hats along with other protective measures such as toeboards, screens, or guardrail systems (1926.451(h)). Historical accident reports demonstrate fatalities and severe injuries resulting from lack of head protection during scaffold operations.",

        "Immediately enforce the mandatory use of hard hats for all employees working on or near scaffolds at all times during operations.",
        "Conduct safety briefings and training sessions emphasizing the importance of wearing hard hats and other personal protective equipment.",
        "Implement supervisory checks and penalties for non-compliance to ensure consistent adherence to head protection policies.",
        "Provide and maintain adequate quantities of hard hats onsite to prevent shortages or excuses for non-use.",
