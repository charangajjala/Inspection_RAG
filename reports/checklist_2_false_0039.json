      "checklist_result": "False",
      "risk_level": "Critical",
      "risk_justification": "Unsecured scaffold sections compromise the stability and structural integrity of the scaffold, potentially leading to collapse or falls from height. Historical accident reports highlight severe injuries and fatalities caused by scaffold failures due to improper securing (e.g., falls from scaffold components or platform collapse).",
      "finding": "The scaffold sections at this site were observed not to be pinned or secured adequately. This violates fundamental scaffold erection requirements, increasing the risk of displacement, tipping, or collapse under load or during use. OSHA standards require scaffold components to be securely fastened to prevent shifting or accidental detachment during use, ensuring the platform's structural integrity and employee safety.",

        "Immediately pin and secure all scaffold sections following manufacturer's specifications and OSHA requirements.",
        "Conduct a comprehensive inspection by a competent person to verify that all components are properly fastened before scaffold use.",

      "risk_justification": "Using cross braces as means of access violates OSHA's explicit prohibition and is a known risk factor for falls, causing serious and sometimes fatal injuries. Numerous accident investigations cite unsafe climbing practices on scaffolds as causative factors for falls and injuries.",
      "finding": "Scaffold access/egress at the site involves climbing on cross braces, which are not designed or permitted to be used as ladders. This unsafe practice increases the risk of slips, trips, and falls from height. OSHA mandates use of designated safe access methods such as ladders, stair towers, ramps, or integral scaffold frames for climbing.",
      "action_items": [
        "Remove all use of cross braces for access and replace with OSHA-compliant access methods (e.g., ladders, stair towers).",
        "Provide training and supervision to ensure employees understand and comply with safe scaffold access requirements.",
