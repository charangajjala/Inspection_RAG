Past incidents have shown that failure to maintain appropriate clearance can lead to electrocution, severe injury, or death. For example, accidents documented have involved scaffold components or employees contacting live power lines, resulting in fatalities and serious injuries. OSHA standard 1926.451(f)(6) specifies required clearance distances and mandates safe work practices to prevent these hazards.",
