      "risk_justification": "The OSHA standard explicitly prohibits use of crossbraces as a means of access or egress due to fall hazards (29 CFR 1926.451(e)(1)). Historical accident reports indicate that improper scaffold access methods have resulted in severe falls and fatalities (e.g., falls from scaffold frames or ladders leading to fractures and fatal injuries). Unsafe scaffold access presents a significant fall risk.",
      "finding": "The inspection revealed that employees are using crossbraces for scaffold access, which is explicitly prohibited by OSHA standards. Climbing on crossbraces lacks the stability, secure footing, and handholds that safe access methods provide and increases the risk of falls from elevation.",

OSHA requires specific clearance distances and adherence to electrical safety practices (29 CFR 1926.451(f)(6)). The presence of tools/materials within prohibited proximity poses an immediate life-threatening hazard.",
