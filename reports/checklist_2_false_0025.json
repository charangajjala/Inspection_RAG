      "risk_justification": "The absence of guardrails and toeboards on scaffold edges exposes workers to fall hazards and risk of falling objects, which OSHA identifies as a frequent cause of severe injuries and fatalities in scaffold-related incidents. Historical accident reports indicate multiple fatal falls and serious injuries associated with missing or insufficient guardrails and fall protection (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4, 18).",
      "finding": "The scaffold inspection revealed that guardrails and toeboards are not installed on all open sides. This is a significant safety violation as it fails to provide the mandatory fall protection for employees working at elevations. Such conditions have been linked to fatal falls and serious injuries in prior accident investigations where lack of proper guardrails was a critical factor. Adequate fall protection systems, including guardrails, midrails, and toeboards, must be continuously maintained to prevent falls and falling object hazards.",

OSHA standards specify this requirement to ensure sound footing and structural integrity. Accident reports document injuries from scaffold displacement and tipping due to unstable foundations (Documents 2, 41).",
      "finding": "The inspection found the scaffold legs, posts, frames, and uprights are not supported on proper baseplates and mudsills or equivalent firm foundations.
