      "risk_justification": "Climbing on crossbraces is explicitly prohibited by OSHA 1926.451(e)(1). Unsafe access methods have historically resulted in falls and serious injuries, including fatal incidents as documented in accident reports where improper access led to fatal falls from height.",
      "finding": "Employees are currently using crossbraces to access the scaffold. This method is unsafe and prohibited by OSHA standards because crossbraces do not provide proper footing or handholds. Unsafe access can cause loss of balance and falls from height, as emphasized in OSHA regulations and supported by accident report evidence showing fatal and serious injuries due to improper scaffold access.",

      "risk_justification": "The scaffold front face distance exceeds OSHA maximum limits of 14 inches for supported scaffolds and 3 inches for outrigger scaffolds (1926.451(b)(3)). Excessive distance can increase fall risk due to instability, loss of balance over open edges, and decreased guardrail efficacy. Historical accident reports show falls caused or contributed to by improper scaffold platform setup and unstable positions.",
      "finding": "The scaffold platform front face is not positioned within the OSHA-specified clearance of 14 inches from the work surface (3 inches for outrigger scaffolds). This non-compliance presents a fall hazard as employees are exposed to greater risk of losing balance or stepping off the platform, particularly if guardrails or personal fall arrest systems are not adequate.",

        "Adjust scaffold platform positioning to ensure the front face is within 14 inches of the work surface or 3 inches for outrigger scaffolds.",
