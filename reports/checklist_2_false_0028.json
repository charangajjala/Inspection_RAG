      "risk_level": "Critical",
      "risk_justification": "The use of crossbraces as a means of access is explicitly prohibited by OSHA standards (1926.451(e)(1)) due to severe fall hazards. Historical accident reports demonstrate falls from scaffolds caused by unsafe access, leading to fatalities and serious injuries. Climbing on crossbraces increases the risk of slipping or structural collapse, which can cause falls from height.",
      "finding": "The scaffold inspection reveals that employees use crossbraces to access the scaffold platform, which violates OSHA standard 1926.451(e)(1) that expressly prohibits this practice. This unsafe access method exposes employees to fall hazards that have historically led to fatal and severe injuries, as evidenced by accident reports documenting falls and crush injuries when scaffold components failed or were improperly used for access. Adequate scaffold access such as ladders, stair towers, ramps, or prefabricated scaffold frames must be provided and used exclusively.",

      "risk_justification": "Inadequate clearance from energized power lines creates a severe electrocution hazard, which has resulted in multiple fatalities and serious electrical injuries in recorded incidents. OSHA 1926.451(f)(6) mandates specific clearance distances and requires notifying utility operators or de-energizing lines to prevent electrical contact. Failure to maintain clearance exposes employees to deadly electrical arcs or shocks.",
      "finding": "The scaffold does not comply with OSHA-required minimum clearance distances from energized power lines. Historical accident data highlight fatal electrocution incidents involving scaffolds placed too close to high-voltage conductors. This violation places workers at critical risk of electrical contact, resulting in severe burns, trauma, and death. Appropriate clearance must be verified and maintained, with utility companies coordinated for line de-energization or protection where necessary.",
