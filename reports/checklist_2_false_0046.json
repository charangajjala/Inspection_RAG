      "finding": "Tools and materials were observed near energized power lines without maintaining the minimum 10-foot clearance distance required for electrical safety. This violation significantly increases the risk of electrical shock or electrocution to employees working on or near the scaffold. Historical accident reports demonstrate fatalities and severe injuries resulting from such contact with electrified conductors, underscoring the critical nature of this safety issue.",
