      "risk_justification": "Non-compliance with platform distance requirements can lead to fall hazards if employees lean or stretch to reach the work. OSHA standard 1926.451(b)(3) limits the distance to reduce fall risks. Accident reports show that falls from scaffold edges without proper proximity or guardrails have resulted in severe injuries and fatalities.",
      "finding": "The inspection revealed that the scaffold platforms are not positioned within the required 14 inches from the work face, or within 3 inches for outrigger scaffolds. This situation increases the risk of falls as workers may need to overreach or lean dangerously, or the scaffold may not provide adequate fall protection. OSHA standards require these distances to minimize fall hazards and ensure worker safety.",
