      "checklist_result": "False",
      "risk_level": "High",
      "risk_justification": "Scaffolds with platforms extending beyond the acceptable distance from the work surface increase the risk of falls due to unstable footing and lack of proper fall protection, as supported by accident reports where scaffold falls and tipping occurred due to instability and improper platform configuration.",
      "finding": "The scaffold's front face is not positioned within the acceptable proximity to the work surface, exceeding 14 inches for standard scaffolds or 3 inches for outrigger scaffolds. This condition creates a hazardous work environment by increasing the risk of falls from the scaffold or loss of balance. OSHA regulations specify strict limits on the distance to the work surface to ensure stability and the ability to provide adequate fall protection, including guardrails and personal fall arrest systems.",
      "action_items": [
        "Reposition or adjust scaffold platforms so that the front face is within 14 inches of the work or within 3 inches for outrigger scaffolds as required by OSHA standards.",
        "Install guardrail systems or provide personal fall arrest systems as additional fall protection when platform width cannot be reduced to comply.",
        "Conduct a competent person evaluation to ensure scaffold stability and compliance with spacing requirements before work resumes.",
