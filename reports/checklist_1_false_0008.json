      "risk_level": "Critical",
      "risk_justification": "Improper or unstable footing support on scaffold legs, posts, frames, and uprights significantly increases the risk of scaffold collapse or displacement, which can cause fatal or severe injuries as supported by multiple OSHA standards and accident reports.",
      "finding": "The scaffold legs, posts, frames, and uprights at this site are not properly bearing on baseplates and mudsills or other adequate firm foundation. OSHA standards (1926.451(c)(2)) require supported scaffold poles, legs, posts, frames, and uprights to bear on base plates and mud sills or other firm foundations that are level, sound, rigid, and capable of supporting the loaded scaffold without settling or displacement. Failure to meet these requirements creates a serious hazard of scaffold instability and potential collapse. Historical accident reports document fatal falls and severe injuries resulting from scaffold instability and collapse when scaffold components were improperly supported or braced.",

        "Immediately review and replace or install baseplates and mudsills under all scaffold legs, posts, frames, and uprights to ensure firm, level, and rigid footing.",

        "Ensure no unstable objects (e.g., bricks, blocks, makeshift devices) are used to support scaffold components.",
        "Assign a competent person to inspect scaffold footing and support conditions before each work shift and after any event that could affect scaffold integrity.",
