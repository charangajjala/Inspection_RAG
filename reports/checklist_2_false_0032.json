      "checklist_result": "False",
      "risk_level": "Critical",
      "risk_justification": "Climbing on cross braces is explicitly prohibited by OSHA standards as it creates high fall risk due to instability and lack of proper footholds. Historical accident reports reveal severe injuries and fatalities linked to falls from scaffolds when unsafe access methods were used.",
      "finding": "The inspection revealed that employees are accessing the scaffold by climbing on cross braces, which is prohibited by OSHA 29 CFR 1926.451(e)(1). Cross braces are not designed to be climbing devices and their use for access significantly increases the risk of falls and serious injury or death. This violation is critical because it directly compromises the safety of employees working on or around the scaffold.",

        "Immediately discontinue use of cross braces as access or egress points.",

Failure to support scaffold legs properly can result in scaffold collapse or tipping, as supported by accident reports of scaffold collapses causing serious injuries and fatalities.",
      "finding": "The scaffold inspection revealed that legs, posts, frames, or uprights are not properly resting on baseplates and mudsills or equivalent firm foundations, violating OSHA 29 CFR 1926.451(c)(2). This improper footing compromises the stability and load capacity of the scaffold structure, increasing the likelihood of scaffold failure or collapse, posing a significant safety hazard to employees working on or near the scaffold.",
