      "finding": "The inspection revealed that scaffold sections are not all pinned or appropriately secured. Per OSHA standards 1926.451(d)(10), scaffold components must be inspected for visible defects and secured properly before use. Failure to do so can allow scaffold instability and collapse. Accident reports show fatal falls and severe injuries have occurred when scaffold parts failed or became loose during use or erection.",

OSHA 1926.451(f)(6) mandates specific clearance distances to prevent electrical contact hazards. Numerous accident reports document electrocutions and electrical burns resulting from inadequate clearance between scaffolding equipment and power lines.",
