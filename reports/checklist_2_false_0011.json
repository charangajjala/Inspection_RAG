      "risk_level": "High",
      "risk_justification": "The failure to wear hard hats significantly increases the risk of serious head injuries from falling hand tools, debris, or other materials, as consistently highlighted in OSHA standards (1926.451(h)) and accident reports documenting head trauma fatalities and injuries.",
      "finding": "During the inspection, it was observed that employees working on or near the scaffold were not wearing hard hats. OSHA standards require that employees on scaffolds be provided with adequate protection from falling objects, which includes wearing hard hats. Failure to comply elevates the risk of head injuries from falling debris or tools, as supported by multiple accident reports where head injuries proved fatal or debilitating.",
