      "risk_justification": "The absence of guardrails and toeboards on all open sides significantly increases the risk of falls from elevation and potential falling object hazards, which have been shown in accident reports to cause severe injuries and fatalities.",
      "finding": "During inspection, it was noted that guardrails and toeboards were not installed on all open sides of the scaffold platform. OSHA requires guardrail systems to be installed along all open sides and ends of platforms before the scaffold is used by employees other than erection and dismantling crews. Lack of these protective systems exposes workers to fall hazards and endangers nearby workers and passersby from falling tools or debris. Historical accident evidence demonstrates that missing guardrails contribute to fatal falls and serious injuries.",

OSHA standards mandate specific separation distances to prevent accidental contact or proximity hazards.

This non-compliance significantly endangers workers' lives and must be immediately rectified.",
