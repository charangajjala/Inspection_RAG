      "risk_justification": "Using crossbraces as access points is prohibited by OSHA standards due to the risk of falls and serious injuries. Historical accident reports confirm falls due to improper access methods result in severe injuries or fatalities.",
      "finding": "Employees are accessing the scaffold by climbing on crossbraces, which is explicitly prohibited by OSHA standard 1926.451(e)(1). Crossbraces do not provide safe footholds or handholds and increase the risk of falls. Several accident reports have documented serious injuries and fatalities due to improper scaffold access, highlighting the critical nature of this issue.",

        "Immediately remove any use of crossbraces as a means of access or egress.",

      "finding": "The inspection revealed that not all scaffold sections are pinned or properly secured, compromising the structural stability of the scaffold. OSHA regulations require all scaffold components to be secured to prevent displacement and swaying (1926.451(c)(3)). Scaffold collapses or tipping due to unsecured sections have historically caused fatal and severe injuries including crushing and blunt force trauma.",
