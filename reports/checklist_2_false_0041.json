OSHA standards (29 CFR 1926.451(f)(6)) strictly require specific clearance distances to prevent contact with power lines. Historical accident reports confirm that contact or close proximity to energized power lines has resulted in fatalities and serious injuries due to electrocution or electrical burns.
