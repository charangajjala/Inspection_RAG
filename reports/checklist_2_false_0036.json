      "finding": "During the inspection, it was observed that not all scaffold sections were pinned or appropriately secured. This violation creates a substantial risk of scaffold instability or collapse, exposing workers to high fall hazards and the potential for serious injury or death. OSHA mandates that scaffolds and scaffold components be inspected by a competent person before each use and that all parts are secured to prevent movement and displacement (29 CFR 1926.451(d)(10), 1926.451(c)(3)). Historical accident reports demonstrate the grave consequences of scaffold failure due to unsecured components.",

      "finding": "The scaffold platform's front face was found to be positioned beyond the OSHA permissible distance of 14 inches from the work surface, or 3 feet for outrigger scaffolds. This can result in employees reaching excessively to perform tasks, increasing the likelihood of loss of balance or accidental falls. OSHA standards require that scaffold platforms be positioned within these distances or be supplemented with guardrail systems or personal fall arrest systems to reduce fall risk (29 CFR 1926.451(b)(3), 1926.451(g)(4)). Failure to comply with these requirements has been a factor in past injuries and fatalities.",
