      "risk_level": "Critical",
      "risk_justification": "Proximity to energized power lines poses an immediate electrocution hazard, as demonstrated in multiple accident reports where contact with energized lines resulted in fatal and severe electrical injuries.",
      "finding": "The inspection revealed that tools and materials on the scaffold are not maintained at the required minimum distance of 10 feet from energized power lines. This condition exposes employees to the risk of electrical shock or electrocution due to accidental contact with live electrical wires. Historical accident reports show fatal electrocutions and severe injuries from scaffold components or materials contacting energized lines, highlighting the critical nature of maintaining adequate clearance.",

        "Remove or relocate tools and materials to maintain at least 10 feet clearance from all energized power lines.",
