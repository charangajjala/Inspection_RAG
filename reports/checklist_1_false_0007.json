OSHA standards explicitly require scaffold poles, legs, posts, frames, and uprights to bear on base plates and mud sills or other adequate firm foundation to prevent settling or displacement (1926.451(c)(2)). Historical accident contexts detail fatal falls and injuries resulting from scaffold collapses or tipping due to inadequate footing conditions.",
