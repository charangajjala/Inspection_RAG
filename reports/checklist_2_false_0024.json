      "risk_level": "Critical",
      "risk_justification": "Lack of guardrails and toeboards on all open sides significantly increases the risk of falls from elevation, which has historically resulted in fatal and severe injuries, as documented in several accident reports involving scaffold falls leading to fatal blunt force trauma and serious fractures. OSHA standards mandate guardrail installation to prevent falls and provide falling object protection, confirming the critical severity of this deficiency.",
      "finding": "The absence of guardrails and toeboards on all open scaffold sides presents a serious fall hazard to workers on the platform and increases the likelihood of falling objects striking personnel below. This non-compliance exposes employees to fall risks demonstrated to cause fatal and severe injuries in past incidents involving scaffold guardrail failures or removals.",

        "Inspect guardrail components for structural integrity, proper height, and no use of prohibited materials such as steel or plastic banding.",
